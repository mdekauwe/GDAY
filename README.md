# GDAY model

GDAY (Generic Decomposition And Yield) is a simple ecosystem model that simulates carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics at the stand scale (Comins and McMurtrie, 1993; Medlyn et al. 2000; Corbeels et al. 2005a,b).

The model can be run at either a daily time step, or a 30-minute time step. When the model is run at the sub-daily timescale, photosynthesis is calculated using a two-leaf (sunlit/shade) approximation (de Pury and Farquhar, 1997; Wang and Leuning, 1998), otherwise photosynthesis is calculated following Sands (1995;1996). The sub-daily approach (photosynthesis & leaf energy balance) mirrors [MAESPA](http://maespa.github.io/manual.html), without the complexity of the radiation treatment. In the standard model the water balance is represented simply, with two (fixed) soil water "buckets", which represent a top soil (e.g. 5 cm) and a larger root-zone. If you are using the sub-daily version, there is now the option to use a [SPA](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/mwilliam/spa.html)-style representation of hydraulics. GDAY-SPA resolves multiple soil layers, soil and leaf water potential and limits gas exchange following the Emax approach (see [MAESPA](http://maespa.github.io/manual.html) for more details).

GDAY uses a modified version of the [CENTURY](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/century/) model to simulate soil carbon and nutrient dynamics (Parton et al. 1987; 1993).

## Installation
To get the code your best route is probably to fork the repository, there is a nice [explanation on github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

The model is coded entirely in C without any dependancies. The wrapper files
for the example scripts and the script used to change parameter options,
are written in python. The old python version is still [online](https://github.com/mdekauwe/pygday).

There is a Makefile in the src directory...

```bash
$ make clean ; make
```

The Makefile will need to be edited by hand to set the $ARCH flag, which sets the installation path. Currently it is hardwired to my computer.

## Running the model
A simple model usage can be displayed by calling GDAY as follows:

```bash
$ gday -u
```

Presently, there are only two options which the user can set via the command line. All model options, including *all* of the model parameters are customisable via the parameter file.

To spin-up GDAY:

```bash
$ gday -s -p param_file.cfg
```

To run GDAY:

```bash
$ gday -p param_file.cfg
```

When the model is run it expects to find its "model state" (i.e. from a previous spin-up) in the parameter file. This state is automatically written the parameter file after the initial spin-up when the "print_options" flag has been set to "end", rather than "daily".


## Parameter file

GDAY expects a parameter file to be supplied as an argument (-p filename) on the command line. Parameter files follow the standard [.INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format, although only a simple INI parser has been coded into GDAY.

Parameter files are broken down into 6 section, namely [git], [files], [params], [control], [state] and [print]. The order of these sections shouldn't make any difference. The basic element contained in the parameter file is the key or property. Every key has a name and a value, delimited by an equals sign (=). The name appears to the left of the equals sign.

```ini
eac = 79430.0
```

As mentioned above, keys are grouped into sections:

```ini
[control]
alloc_model = allometric
deciduous_model = false
```

or

```ini
[files]
cfg_fname = params/NCEAS_DUKE_model_youngforest_amb.cfg
met_fname = met_data/DUKE_met_data_amb_co2.csv
out_fname = outputs/D1GDAYDUKEAMB.csv
out_param_fname = params/NCEAS_DUKE_model_simulation_amb.cfg
```

As all the model parameters are accessible via this file, these files can be quite long. Clearly it isn't necessary to list every parameter. The recommended approach is to use the [base file](example/params/base_start.cfg) and then customise whichever parameters are required via a shell script, e.g. see the python [wrapper script](example/example.py). This file just lists the parameters which needs to be changed and calls [adjust_gday_param_file.py](scripts/adjust_gday_param_file.py) to swap the parameters (listed as a python dictionary) with the default parameter. I have also written an equivalent version in R [adjust_gday_param_file.R](scripts/adjust_gday_param_file.R). I should highlight that I wouldn't necessarily trust the default values :).

Finally, the options to print different the state and flux variables on the fly is a nice hangover from the python implementation. Sadly, this functionality doesn't actually exist in the C code, instead all the state and flux variables used in the FACE intercomparisons are dumped as standard.

When I have time I will write something more extensive (ha), but information about what different variable names refer to are listed in the [header file](src/include/structures.h), which documents the different structures (i.e. control, state, params).

The git hash allows you to connect which version of the model code produced which version of the model output. I'd argue for maintaining this functionality, but if you don't use git or wish to ignore me, filling this line with gibberish and disabling the shell command in the Makefile should allow you to do this.

## Potential gotchas
- The parameter alpha_j which represents the quantum yield of electron transport (mol mol-1) is the intrinsic quantum yield (i.e. per unit APAR). For the two-leaf version of the model, alpha_j should be divided by (1.0 - omega), where omega is the leaf scattering coefficient of PAR (leaf reflectance and transmittance combined). Currently we are assuming omega = 0.15 (radiation.c), this is currently hardwired.

- The deciduous phenology scheme does not currently work with the two-leaf version of the model (can be fixed).

- The current set-up of the model resulted in pmineralisation to be negative from time to time during the spin-up process, as plittreelase can be a negatvie value, and pmineralisation is the result of pgross - pimmob + plittrelease. This resulted in potentially negative total P input from organic to (lab+sorb) mineral P pool, and from time to time, influx into sorbed P pool can be negative. This only affects the spin-up process and seems to not affect the equilibrated results so leave as is for now.

## Nitrogen inputs
Nitrogen (N) entering the system via biological N fixation (BNF; tonnes ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and N deposition (tonnes ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) are prescribed and passed via the met file. If information isn't available from the experiment GDAY is being applied to, BNF can be calculated as a function of evapotranspiration (ET) based on Cleveland et al. 1999.

Following Smith et al. (2014), Biogeosciences and Wieder et al. (2015), ERL,
we also suggest the conservation BNF equation (Fig. 1). For estimates of ET you can either use values by PFT based on Table 1 in Cleveland or use the sum of canopy evaporation and transpiration. Wieder et al (pg 3) argued that using total ET leads to a high bias in BNF estimates in arid regions.

BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) is then calculated as a function of ET:

```python
BNF = 0.102 * (ET * mm_2_cm) + 0.524
```

## Phosphorus component
Organic phosphorus (P) pools and fluxes follow the same modelling structure of the nitrogen. A total of five inorganic phosphorus pools is implemented: labile, sorbed, strongly sorbed, occluded and parent pools. Inorganic phosphorus enters into the system via constant input rate from the parent material pool. Labile and sorbed pools are in dynamic equilibration, and P gradually enters into the strongly sorbed pool and eventually locked up in the occluded pool. Biochemical mineralisation occurs as a function of nitrogen availability. Phosphorus in plant limits photosythesis through its explicit effect on Jmax and a potential effect on Triose-phosphates. 


## Hydraulics
From SPA we borrow the multi-layer soil scheme, which considers infiltration and drainage between layers. We also implement the soil-to-leaf hydraulics from SPA, which includes weighting soil water potential. We limit gas exchange following the Emax approach (Duursma et al. 2008). This approach therefore assumes isohydric behaviour, i.e. the plant maintains a leaf water potential above a critical minimum value.

We do not currently implement the thermal calculations which would allow you to estimate soil temperature.


## Example run
The [example](example) directory has two python scripts which provide an example of how one might set about running the model. [example.py](example.py) simulates the DUKE FACE experiment and [run_experiment.py](run_experiment.py) is just nice a wrapper script around this which produces a plot at the end comparing the data to the observations.

```bash
cd example/
python run_experiment.py
```

This should pop a plot of NPP, LAI and transpiration onto your screen. This example tends to break from time to time when I change various options, so please let me know if it isn't working!

**NB** to use this wrapper script you will need to have an installation of the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) libraries installed. If you are a python user this is fairly standard.
